      <p>
        These libraries are part of the COOL Library program. We're constructing
        and delivering libraries across the College Station and Bryan area to
        promote reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        The libraries are completely free to use. Take a book, read it, and
        simply drop it back off in the used pile
